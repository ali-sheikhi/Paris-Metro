## Paris Metro Tour Problem

The objective is to make at least one pass trough all stations within Paris. Stations outside the city limits may be used in a tour but it is not a requirement.

The Notebook presents two algorithms at an attempt to find the most optimal tour.

They are called Smart Explorer and Ant Explorer (a slightly different version of the classic Ant Colony Optimization algorithm adjusted to the problem at hand)
